      <br>Yeah, this album is dedicated<br>
    To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'<br>
    To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of<br>
    Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)<br>
    And all the niggas in the struggle<br>
    You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby<br>
    It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine<br>
    Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine<br>
    Hangin' pictures on my wall<br>
    Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl<br>
    I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped<br>
    Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock<br>
    Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack<br>
    With the hat to match<br>
    Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha<br>
    You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far<br>
    Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight<br>
    Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade<br>
    Born sinner, the opposite of a winner<br>
    Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner<br>
    Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri<br>
    Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski<br>
    I'm blowin' up like you thought I would<br>
    Call the crib, same number, same hood<br>
    It's all good (It's all good)<br>
    And if you don't know, now you know, nigga<br>
    You know very well<br>
    Who you are<br>
    Don't let 'em hold you down<br>
    Reach for the stars<br>
    You had a goal<br>
    But not that many<br>
    'Cause you're the only one<br>
    I'll give you good and plenty<br>
    I made the change from a common thief<br>
    To up close and personal with Robin Leach<br>
    And I'm far from cheap<br>
    I smoke skunk with my peeps all day<br>
    Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way<br>
    The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy<br>
    Girls used to diss me<br>
    Now they write letters 'cause they miss me<br>
    I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff<br>
    I was too used to packin' gats and stuff<br>
    Now honeys play me close like butter play toast<br>
    From the Mississippi down to the East Coast<br>
    Condos in Queens, indo for weeks<br>
    Sold-out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak<br>
    Livin' life without fear<br>
    Puttin' five karats in my baby girl's ear<br>
    Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool<br>
    Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school<br>
    Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood<br>
    And it's still all good<br>
    And if you don't know, now you know, nigga<br>
    You know very well<br>
    Who you are<br>
    Don't let 'em hold you down<br>
    Reach for the stars<br>
    You had a goal<br>
    But not that many<br>
    'Cause you're the only one<br>
    I'll give you good and plenty<br>
    Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis<br>
    When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this<br>
    50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa<br>
    Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur<br>
    Phone bill about two G's flat<br>
    No need to worry, my accountant handles that<br>
    And my whole crew is loungin'<br>
    Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'<br>
    Thinkin' back on my one-room shack<br>
    Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back<br>
    And she loves to show me off of course<br>
    Smiles every time my face is up in The Source<br>
    We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us<br>
    No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us<br>
    Birthdays was the worst days<br>
    Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty<br>
    Uh, damn right, I like the life I live<br>
    'Cause I went from negative to positive<br>
    And it's all (It's all good, nigga)<br>
    And if you don't know, now you know, nigga<br>
    You know very well<br>
    Who you are<br>
    Don't let 'em hold you down<br>
    And if you don't know, now you know, nigga<br>
    Reach for the stars<br>
    You had a goal<br>
    But not that many<br>
    'Cause you're the only one<br>
    And if you don't know, now you know, nigga<br>
    I'll give you good and plenty<br>
    Representin' B-Town in the house<br>
    Junior Mafia, mad flavor<br>
    Uh, uh, yeah, aight<br>
    You know very well<br>
    Who you are<br>
    Don't let 'em hold you down<br>
    Reach for the stars<br>
    You had a goal<br>
    But not that many
    'Cause you're the only one<br>
    I'll give you good and plenty
    Biggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga<br>
    Junior Mafia, it's all good, nigga<br>
    Bad Boy, it's all good, nigga<br>
    It's all good<br>
    That's right, '94<br>
    And on and on, and on and on<br>
    You know very well<br>
    Who you are<br>
    Don't let 'em hold you down<br>
    Reach for the stars<br>
